# Collapsibility
Collapsibility is a measure of the variability in a node's nodal modularity across the layers of a multiplex network. It is similar conceptually to node flexibility which measures the variability of group assignment in a multiplex network (see Bassett et al. for more information on flexibility https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1018985108). 

Collapsibility is intended to be used with publicly available code on nodal modularity (https://github.com/AvalonC-C/Nodal_Modularity). Furthermore, additional information on nodal modularity is available here: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328736.
